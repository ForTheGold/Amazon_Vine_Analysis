# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Big data analysis

## Background

A startup called Big Market has reached out to us with some of their big data concerns.  Big Market helps small businesses optimize their marketing campaigns.  A client of Big Market named SellBy is preparing to launch a large number of products on leading retail websites such as Amazon.

They would like to see how the reviews of their products compare to similar products being sold by competitors.  Additionally, they are thinking about giving away free products to select reviewers through a promotional program, but would like an analysis on whether or not it is worth the cost.

There are thousands of reviews that need to be translated from words to numbers and analyzed in order to make the necessary conclusions.

## Results

![Results](https://github.com/ForTheGold/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/output.png)

Total Number of Vine Reviews:  1080
Total Number of Nonvine Reviews:  49673
Total Number of Vine 5 Star Reviews:  454
Total Number of Nonvine 5 Star Reviews:  23043
Percent Vine 5 Star Reviews:  42.04 %
Percent Nonvine 5 Star Reviews:  46.39 %

## Summary

We used the Amazon electronics data in order to perform our analysis.  The results show that there are a great deal more reviews that are not from vine than are from vine which makes perfect sense.   The thing that is probably the most interesting is that there are actually a lower number of five star reviews coming from vine than there are from the general public.  This is interesting because there are less five star reviews coming from paid reviewers than from just general users.  The differential is not that big, so it may still be worthwhile to invest in vine and you can tell the general quality of your product quite accurately.
